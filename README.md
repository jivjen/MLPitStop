# MLPitStop
This is going to be the one stop repository to understand and revisit literally anything on Machine Learning.

This guide aims at directly going to the techincal fundamentals and tackling concepts from there and hence you are not going to find any cheesy definitions of what ML is or what AI is.
It's a concise guide for people who really want to avoid all the generic stuff that you find in regular resources and cut straight to the chase.
Kinda like an F1 pit stop - There's no time for chit chat just come here, find what you need and just keep going and win the race!!
